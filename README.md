# [CLOUD DEVELOPER NANODEGREE - UDACITY](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990)

This repo contains my solution code from Cloud Developer Nanodegree.

In this specialization, we learned the fundamentals of cloud development and deployment with AWS. We build different apps leveraging microservices, Kubernetes clusters, and serverless application technology.

The course is structured in 4 modules and a final capstone project:

## Cloud Foundations

Learn the fundamentals of cloud computing while being introduced to compute power, security, storage, networking, messaging, and management services in the cloud.

Module project: Deploy Static Website on AWS

## Full Stack Apps on AWS

Design and deploy scalable, extendable, and maintainable full stack applications using modern cloud architecture.

Module project: Udagram: your own Instagram on AWS

## Monolith to Microservices at Scale

Learn best practices on how to develop and deploy microservices, with a focus on different microservice architecture patterns, independent scaling, resiliency, securing microservices, and best practices for monitoring and logging.

Module project: Refactor Udagram app to Microservices

## Develop and Deploy a Serverless App

Learn both the theory of using serverless technologies with the practice of developing a complex serverless application and focuses on learning by doing. You will learn advanced serverless features such as implementing WebSockets and stream processing.

Module project: Serverless Application

## Capstone project

The purpose of the cloud development capstone project is to give
you a chance to combine what you’ve learned throughout the
program. This project will be an important part of your portfolio that will help you achieve your cloud development-related career goals.
In the capstone project, each project is unique to the student. You’ll build an application on AWS based on predefined criteria. Students will define the scope of the project, come up feature list and decide which AWS services to use to meet availability and performance criteria.
